WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control

The WHO FCTC opened for signature on 16 June to 22 June 2003 in Geneva, and thereafter at the United Nations Headquarters in New York, the Depositary of the treaty, from 30 June 2003 to 29 June 2004. The treaty, which is now closed for signature, has 168 Signatories, including the European Community, which makes it one of the most widely embraced treaties in UN history. Member States that have signed the Convention indicate that they will strive in good faith to ratify, accept, or approve it, and show political commitment not to undermine the objectives set out in it. Countries wishing to become a Party, but that did not sign the Convention by 29 June 2004, may do so by means of accession, which is a one-step process equivalent to ratification.

The Convention entered into force on 27 February 2005 -- 90 days after it has been acceded to, ratified, accepted, or approved by 40 States. Beginning on that date, the forty Contracting Parties are legally bound by the treaty's provisions. For each State that ratifies, accepts or approves the Convention or accedes thereto after the conditions set out in paragraph 1 of Article 36 for entry into force have been fulfilled, the Convention shall enter into force on the ninetieth day following the date of deposit of its instrument of ratification, acceptance, approval or accession. For regional economic integration organizations, the Convention enters into force on the ninetieth day following the date of deposit of its instrument of formal confirmation or accession.

The global network developed over the period of the negotiations of the WHO FCTC will be important in preparing for the implementation of the Convention at country level. In the words of WHO's Director General, Dr Jong-wook LEE:

""The WHO FCTC negotiations have already unleashed a process that has resulted in visible differences at country level. The success of the WHO FCTC as a tool for public health will depend on the energy and political commitment that we devote to implementing it in countries in the coming years. A successful result will be global public health gains for all.""

For this to materialize, the drive and commitment, which was so evident during the negotiations, will need to spread to national and local levels so that the WHO FCTC becomes a concrete reality where it counts most, in countries.",

Foreword

Virtually everything Canadians do is touched by technology in some way – on a per capita basis, we spend the most time online of any country in the world, at 43.5 hours per Canadian per month. We are heavily inter- connected and networked, a fact that enhances our quality of life, but also creates vulnerabilities. From commercial supply chains to the critical infrastructure that underpins our economy and our society, the risks in the cyber world have multiplied, accelerated, and grown increasingly malicious.

Major corporations, industries and our international allies and partners are engaged in the global cyber challenge. But many others are not — representing a significant risk, but also a missed opportunity in this rapidly growing global industry. While it is important to be keenly aware of cyber threats, Canada’s cyber security policy cannot be driven by fear and defensiveness.

With this in mind, the renewal of the existing Cyber Security Strategy has been undertaken with an emphasis on the enormous potential of Canada’s increased leadership in this field. In partnership with the Ministers of Defence, Innovation, Infrastructure, Public Services and the Treasury Board, we consulted directly with Canadians and key stakeholders about how the new strategy could best serve their security needs, while allowing them to benefit from the opportunities that the digital economy offers. Informed by over 2,000 submissions to our public consultation, the Strategy directly addresses the gaps and areas for improvement in Canada’s current

cyber security climate.

The Strategy’s core goals are reflected in Budget 2018’s substantial investments in cyber security – totaling more than $500 million dollars over five years. As the largest single investment in cyber security ever made by the Canadian government, Budget 2018 demonstrates our commitment to safety and security in the digital age.

Executive Summary 

The Importance of Cyber Security

As we embrace digital technologies for their tremendous benefits, we can open ourselves up to threats.

Criminals and other malicious cyber threat actors — many of which operate outside our borders — take advantage of security gaps, low cyber security awareness, and technological developments in an effort to compromise cyber systems. They steal personal and financial information, intellectual property, and trade secrets. They disrupt and sometimes destroy the infrastructure that we rely on for essential services and our way of life.

In 2010, the Government of Canada launched a national effort to defend against these threats with Canada’s first Cyber Security Strategy. The progress made and accomplishments achieved under the 2010 Strategy are the basis for future action.

Our new approach reflects the extent to which digital technologies have become essential to our way of life. With a new Cyber Security Strategy, we can proceed with confidence in our digital age. In this reality, cyber security is the companion to innovation and the protector of prosperity.

The Vision of the National Cyber Security Strategy: Security and prosperity in the digital age

Strong cyber security is an essential element of Canadian innovation and prosperity. Individuals, governments, and businesses all want to have confidence in the cyber systems that underpin their daily lives. The Government of Canada envisions a future in which all Canadians play an active role in shaping and sustaining our nation’s cyber resilience.

We all have a responsibility to secure these technologies. Through our National Cyber Security Strategy, the Government of Canada will advance the ways in which we work together to do so.

Raising Baseline Cyber Security in Canada

The vast majority of Canada’s digital systems are owned by individuals and organizations outside of the federal government. From individuals that use few technologies to tech-savvy businesses that are firmly rooted in the online world, many do not realize that they could be the target of cyber threats. As a result, they do not have measures in place to protect

The Government of Canada is taking on a leadership role in cyber security to help organizations and Canadians recognize the value of cyber security and to support efforts to raise the baseline of cyber security in Canada. It will complement these domestic efforts by working with international partners and allies, seeking to reduce the threat to Canada from cybercriminals and also from state actors and their proxies that may seek to harm us.

Moreover, the federal government is aiming for national cyber security excellence. Reaching this target will involve enhancing and growing cyber security capabilities in government and industry. It will entail supporting Canada’s leading edge research and development, as well as the range of organizations and businesses that do not have strong cyber security measures in place. Private sector leaders will have a central role to play, as a collaborative effort is needed to ensure that all Canadians are as equipped

as possible to prevent and respond to cyber threats.

Blockchain technology allows for the creation of online ledgers or records. Often associated with virtual currencies, there are many possible applications of blockchain. It could be used to provide public services like issuing passports, creating records of contracts or legal documents, and processing payments for services rendered.

8,9,What are the key findings of the CyberPeace Institute's analysis of cyber threats affecting NGOs in International Geneva?,5,5_CyberPeace_Report,"Introduction

In the heart of International Geneva, a diverse ecosystem thrives, housing 38 international organizations (IOs), 432 non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and several hundred associations active at an international level, all united by a shared mission: to make the world a place of greater humanity, peace and justice. NGOs are the unsung heroes, responding in armed conflicts, natural disasters, and humanitarian crises, championing human rights, and advancing the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Like many other organizations, NGOs heavily rely on technology, which is critical for projecting their activities globally in real time. Yet, in today’s digital landscape, this reality brings its own set of challenges.

While fighting for the greater good, NGOs must battle against all forms of cyberattacks, ranging from espionage and ransomware to fraud and disinformation. On one side, they are targeted by various threat actors - criminal groups, state actors, terrorist groups or hacktivists - seeking to disrupt their work, compromise data, and tarnish their reputation. On the other, they do not possess the human or financial resources to protect themselves.

In Geneva, the CyberPeace Institute safeguards these heroes. Our cybersecurity services for NGOs include threat landscape mapping, volunteer-led consulting, alert notifications, and providing policy recommendations to donors and public/private decision-makers. All these services are free and tailored to the NGOs’ operational reality.

With the leadership and support of the Republic and Canton of Geneva, this report aims to provide actionable recommendations to build capacities and resilience to mitigate cyber risks. It provides insights on the organizational readiness of NGOs to prevent, respond to and recover from cyberattacks. Using data, including primary data from surveys and interviews, the Report looks at the threats NGOs face, the vulnerabilities they are exposed to, and examines their preparedness to mitigate these challenges. Its ambition is to reinforce NGOs’ resilience in a sustainable manner, and for them to become the primary actors of their cybersecurity.

This report builds on technical analysis conducted by our cyber analysts and a comprehensive survey with 27 Geneva-based NGOs.

CyberPeace Institute | 2023

The sample size of 27 NGOs allowed for a detailed examination of each participating NGO, providing an understanding of their unique contexts, challenges, and practices. This depth of analysis can yield nuanced insights that may be obscured in larger samples. These organizations have been selected because they embody the diversity of Geneva NGOs: some conduct their activities in Geneva whilst others operate across the world. Some are small and under-financed, others are well established. They operate in sectors including healthcare, justice, human rights, peace and education and humanitarian relief. Together, these NGOs bring vital aid and services to tens of millions of beneficiaries.

If you are an NGO looking for help with your cybersecurity, we encourage you to reach out to us. We are here to support and protect your vital work in our increasingly digital world.

The CyberPeace Institute is an independent and neutral non- governmental organisation (NGO) that strives to reduce the frequency, impact, and scale of cyberattacks, to hold actors accountable for the harm they cause, and to assist vulnerable communities.

The Institute is based in Geneva, works in close collaboration with relevant partners to reduce the harm from cyberattacks on people’s lives worldwide, and provide assistance. By analysing cyberattacks, it exposes their societal impact, the ways that international laws and norms are being violated, and advances responsible behaviour to enforce cyberpeace.","At the heart of the Institute’s efforts is the recognition that cyberspace is about people. It supports providers of essential services to the most vulnerable members of society, ultimately benefiting us all.

CyberPeace Analytical Report

Why this Analysis? From Data to Action

The aim of this analysis project is to increase understanding of the cyber threat landscape affecting NGOs and aims to provide actionable recommendations.

These recommendations address the following areas:

1. How NGOs can better defend and protect themselves from cyberattacks and their associated impact and harm. A separate technical report is also provided to NGOs with more specificities on technical findings from this project.

2. How donors, policymakers, and companies can contribute to safeguarding NGOs in the face of cyber threats.

Although the focus of the current report is on Geneva-based organizations, this methodology will be replicated in other contexts and serve as a blueprint for future reports on cyber threats against NGOs.

This report is part of the CyberPeace Institute’s broader mission, offering free cybersecurity services to NGOs which includes:

■ Mapping the threat landscape for NGOs.

■ Delivering actionable, free cybersecurity services to NGOs (CyberPeace Builders program1).

■ Producing threat intelligence and automatically alerting NGOs about suspicious cyber activity.

■ Building capacity amongst donors cybersecurity risks of NGOs. to understand the

■ Providing data-driven evidence to regulators.

CyberPeace Analytical Report","Limitations

This report highlights the range of threats NGOs are facing in International Geneva, but does not aim to serve as a comprehensive guide for the issues discussed. Our analysis did not include questions in relation to the NGOs understanding of the legal and regulatory environment in Switzerland and/or the countries they operate in, which although of importance was not the focus. For example, data protection regulations are key considerations for NGOs managing data which must be respected, with reporting obligations in the event of data breaches.

The report purposefully omits detailed information regarding the NGOs that took part in this project. The analysis involved organisations disclosing sensitive information about their vulnerabilities and threat profiles. As such, this precaution is taken to protect the privacy and safety of all the organisations.

This report is not exhaustive and acknowledges that there are other threats, vulnerabilities and actors that come into play from those mentioned herein. There is little available analysis focused on the cyber threat and cybersecurity capacities specific to NGOs. A significant proportion of the analysis currently available is focused on threat actors and their tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) with very limited information on victims, targets and the societal impact of attacks. This report advocates systematic and standardized collection, analysis and sharing of information to provide better responses and facilitate international collaboration.

CyberPeace Institute | 2023","Recommendations for the International Geneva

While the key findings shed light on the critical challenges that NGOs in International Geneva face in the realm of cybersecurity, the following recommendations provide a concrete roadmap for action. These recommendations are structured according to a cyber capacity building framework developed by the United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research (UNIDIR)2, covering five key pillars: official documents, processes and structures, partnerships and networks, people and skills, and technology.

Official Documents Related to Cybersecurity Matters:

• NGOs should be recognized as stakeholders with specific needs to which host authorities pay particular attention. Given the role of NGOs, promoting their cybersecurity should be integrated strongly into policies.

• Geneva-based NGOs should develop and implement cybersecurity governance policies and practices, including a cybersecurity policy, an incident response plan, and an asset inventory. The CyberPeace Institute, as a local partner, commits to help them do that.

• The CyberPeace Institute and its academic partners should enhance their efforts to document, track, and analyze cyberattacks against NGOs within the Geneva ecosystem and any subsequent accountability measures taken, including the prosecution of perpetrators.

Processes and Structures:

• Swiss Public authorities should recognize the specific needs of NGOs. In cases involving ransomware, investigations into the financial flow stemming from extortion schemes should be conducted to hinder the activities of threat actors. Public authorities should actively promote the position discouraging the payment of ransom, emphasizing that it directly finances organized crime and encourages further cyberattacks.

• Swiss Public authorities, together with the National Cyber Security Center (NCSC), should actively promote transparent reporting on cyberattacks against NGOs to inform policy-making. Robust

Case Study #2: Attack on an NGO website

1. Overview

This case study is about a small NGO based in Geneva whose mission is to provide professional and independent services to assist humanitarian and development organizations in their work. The organization’s website serves as a central platform for communication with partners and clients.

In early 2020, this NGO experienced a cyberattack resulting in the compromise of their website, causing significant disruption to their operations. This case study explores the details of the attack, the organization's response, the impact on their operations, lessons learned, and recommendations.

2. What happened?

In early 2020, the organization fell victim to a website attack. When trying to connect to the website, they discovered that they were automatically redirected to a Chinese language marketplace website. The exact timing of the attack remains uncertain, as it was discovered during a period of reduced monitoring.

Unfortunately, the organization did not have a backup of their website, requiring a full reconstruction of the site which took nine months to complete. While the organization does not believe that they were deliberately targeted by the cyberattack, it appears the attackers were aiming to generate traffic to the marketplace website. The identity of the threat actor remains unknown, and there is no attribution or evidence linking any individual or group to the attack.

What is a website attack?

A website attack refers to a malicious activity or series of actions aimed at compromising the security, functionality, or availability of a website or web application. These attacks target vulnerabilities in websites to gain unauthorized access, steal data, deface web pages, disrupt services, or carry out other malicious activities. Website attacks are typically orchestrated by cybercriminals, hackers, or other threat actors.

39

CyberPeace Analytical Report

There are different types of website attacks. Some of the most common ones include:

■ SQL Injection (SQLi): In an SQL Injection attack, an attacker injects malicious SQL queries into input fields on a website.

■ Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): XSS attacks involve injecting malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users.

■ Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF): In CSRF attacks, attackers trick users into unknowingly executing actions on a website without their consent.

■ Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS): DDoS attacks flood a website's server with a massive volume of traffic, overwhelming its resources and causing it to cease functioning normally or to become unavailable to legitimate users. It is said to be distributed when the source of the attack is composed of a multitude of devices or systems.

■ Website Defacement: The illicit or unauthorized modification of the appearance and content of a target’s website or the act of redirecting traffic to other web pages.",Case Studies Case Study #1: Ransomware Attack on an NGO Case Study #2: Attack on an NGO Website Case Study #3: Responding to a Man-in-the-Middle cyberattack Appendix A: Detailed recommendations Organizational recommendations Technical Recommendations Basic Cybersecurity Measures: Enhanced Cybersecurity Measures: Project scope and participation of NGOs Limitations 35 35 35 39 43 48 48 48 50 50 51 52 52 54 55 60,
