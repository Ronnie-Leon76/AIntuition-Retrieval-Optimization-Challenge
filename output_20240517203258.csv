Preamble

The Parties to this Convention,

Determined to give priority to their right to protect public health,

Recognizing that the spread of the tobacco epidemic is a global problem with serious consequences for public health that calls for the widest possible international cooperation and the participation of all countries in an effective, appropriate and comprehensive international response,

Reflecting the concern of the international community about the devastating worldwide health, social, economic and environmental consequences of tobacco consumption and exposure to tobacco smoke,

Seriously concerned about the increase in the worldwide consumption and production of cigarettes and other tobacco products, particularly in developing countries, as well as about the burden this places on families, on the poor, and on national health systems,

Recognizing that scientific evidence has unequivocally established that tobacco consumption and exposure to tobacco smoke cause death, disease and disability, and that there is a time lag between the exposure to smoking and the other uses of tobacco products and the onset of tobacco-related diseases,

Recognizing also that cigarettes and some other products containing tobacco are highly engineered so as to create and maintain dependence, and that many of the compounds they contain and the smoke they produce are pharmacologically active, toxic, mutagenic and carcinogenic, and that tobacco dependence is separately classified as a disorder in major international classifications of diseases,

Acknowledging that there is clear scientific evidence that prenatal exposure to tobacco smoke causes adverse health and developmental conditions for children,

Deeply concerned about the escalation in smoking and other forms of tobacco consumption by children and adolescents worldwide, particularly smoking at increasingly early ages,

Alarmed by the increase in smoking and other forms of tobacco consumption by women and young girls worldwide and keeping in mind the need for full participation of women at all levels of policy-making and implementation and the need for gender-specific tobacco control strategies,

1

WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control

Deeply concerned about the high levels of smoking and other forms of tobacco consumption by indigenous peoples,

Seriously concerned about the impact of all forms of advertising, promotion and sponsorship aimed at encouraging the use of tobacco products,

Recognizing that cooperative action is necessary to eliminate all forms of illicit trade in cigarettes and other tobacco products, including smuggling, illicit manufacturing and counterfeiting,

Acknowledging that tobacco control at all levels and particularly in developing countries and in countries with economies in transition requires sufficient financial and technical resources commensurate with the current and projected need for tobacco control activities,

Recognizing the need to develop appropriate mechanisms to address the long-term social and economic implications of successful tobacco demand reduction strategies,

Mindful of the social and economic difficulties that tobacco control programmes may engender in the medium and long term in some developing countries and countries with economies in transition, and recognizing their need for technical and financial assistance in the context of nationally developed strategies for sustainable development,

Conscious of the valuable work being conducted by many States on tobacco control and commending the leadership of the World Health Organization as well as the efforts of other organizations and bodies of the United Nations system and other international and regional intergovernmental organizations in developing measures on tobacco control,","and cessation ............................................................................................13 Part IV: Measures relating to the reduction of the supply of tobacco ..............13 Illicit trade in tobacco products................................................................13 Article 15 Sales to and by minors .............................................................................15 Article 16 Provision of support for economically viable Article 17 alternative activities .................................................................................16 Protection of the environment...............................................................16 Protection of the environment and the health of persons .........................16 Questions related to liability..................................................................17 Liability....................................................................................................17 Scientific and technical cooperation and communication of information.........................................................................................17 Research, surveillance and exchange of information ...............................17 Reporting and exchange of information...................................................19 Cooperation in the scientific, technical and legal fields and provision of related expertise ............................................................20 Institutional arrangements and financial resources............................21 Conference of the Parties .........................................................................21 Secretariat.................................................................................................22

In a world in crisis, protecting NGOs is an emergency.

Foreword

Stéphane Duguin,

Chief Executive Officer, CyberPeace Institute

Despite 25 years spent collecting evidence at crime scenes, gathering testimonies, tracking down perpetrators of crimes and being confronted with the worst that the human mind can imagine, I am still stunned by criminals lack of shame.

Before becoming Chief Executive Officer of the CyberPeace Institute, I admit I never looked into the situation of non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and did not understand the precarity within which they operate in cyberspace. These last few years have introduced me to a shocking reality, that those who are first on the front line of armed conflicts, in natural disasters and climate crises, are targets, and often victims of cyberattacks. These are attacks against those who invest their hearts, expertise and time to the provision of essential services to people in all parts of the world - from access to drinking water, assistance to refugees, to safeguarding children.

This report bears witness to the cyber reality of NGOs, and supports a conviction: I firmly believe that we can all do more to support NGOs. Civil society, public authorities, philanthropies, academia, media, can collectively enable the urgent support that NGOs need and deserve.

This report is published on the fourth anniversary of the founding of the CyberPeace Institute. Since our creation, we have been providing free cybersecurity support to those who need it most, analysing the threat landscape and advocating for responsible behavior in cyberspace.

This report is a further contribution to this work, and another building block in the construction of collective action to protect those - the NGOs - who help to protect us.

Foreword

Virtually everything Canadians do is touched by technology in some way – on a per capita basis, we spend the most time online of any country in the world, at 43.5 hours per Canadian per month. We are heavily inter- connected and networked, a fact that enhances our quality of life, but also creates vulnerabilities. From commercial supply chains to the critical infrastructure that underpins our economy and our society, the risks in the cyber world have multiplied, accelerated, and grown increasingly malicious.

Major corporations, industries and our international allies and partners are engaged in the global cyber challenge. But many others are not — representing a significant risk, but also a missed opportunity in this rapidly growing global industry. While it is important to be keenly aware of cyber threats, Canada’s cyber security policy cannot be driven by fear and defensiveness.

With this in mind, the renewal of the existing Cyber Security Strategy has been undertaken with an emphasis on the enormous potential of Canada’s increased leadership in this field. In partnership with the Ministers of Defence, Innovation, Infrastructure, Public Services and the Treasury Board, we consulted directly with Canadians and key stakeholders about how the new strategy could best serve their security needs, while allowing them to benefit from the opportunities that the digital economy offers. Informed by over 2,000 submissions to our public consultation, the Strategy directly addresses the gaps and areas for improvement in Canada’s current

cyber security climate.

The Strategy’s core goals are reflected in Budget 2018’s substantial investments in cyber security – totaling more than $500 million dollars over five years. As the largest single investment in cyber security ever made by the Canadian government, Budget 2018 demonstrates our commitment to safety and security in the digital age.

Among the new measures introduced:

• Funding for the new Canadian Centre for Cyber Security to support leadership and collaboration between different levels of government and international partners, while providing a clear and trusted resource for Canadian citizens and businesses.

• The creation of the National Cybercrime Coordination Unit to expand the RCMP’s capacity to investigate cybercrime, establishing a coordination hub for both domestic and international partners.

• Funding to foster innovation and economic growth, and the development of Canadian cyber talent.

The Strategy is the roadmap for Canada’s path forward on cyber security, and is designed to meet the objectives and priorities of Canadians. We are proud to be leading the way.

Executive Summary ","Limitations

This report highlights the range of threats NGOs are facing in International Geneva, but does not aim to serve as a comprehensive guide for the issues discussed. Our analysis did not include questions in relation to the NGOs understanding of the legal and regulatory environment in Switzerland and/or the countries they operate in, which although of importance was not the focus. For example, data protection regulations are key considerations for NGOs managing data which must be respected, with reporting obligations in the event of data breaches.

The report purposefully omits detailed information regarding the NGOs that took part in this project. The analysis involved organisations disclosing sensitive information about their vulnerabilities and threat profiles. As such, this precaution is taken to protect the privacy and safety of all the organisations.

This report is not exhaustive and acknowledges that there are other threats, vulnerabilities and actors that come into play from those mentioned herein. There is little available analysis focused on the cyber threat and cybersecurity capacities specific to NGOs. A significant proportion of the analysis currently available is focused on threat actors and their tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) with very limited information on victims, targets and the societal impact of attacks. This report advocates systematic and standardized collection, analysis and sharing of information to provide better responses and facilitate international collaboration.

The CyberPeace Institute welcomes any feedback to develop this knowledge product. Any enquiries regarding the Project or interest in the analysis process are welcome, please visit the Institute’s website to get in contact.

Cyber Security Strategy Goals 

Effective Leadership, Governance, and Collaboration

The federal government, in close collaboration with provinces, territories, and the private sector, will take a leadership role to advance cyber security in Canada and will, in coordination with allies, work to shape the international cyber security environment in Canada’s favour.

Responding to calls for decisive federal leadership, the Government of Canada will streamline the way it works and collaborates with external partners and stakeholders by establishing a clear focal point for authoritative advice, guidance, and cyber incident response. This approach will improve information sharing and make it easier for the private sector to obtain the support it needs.

The Government of Canada will reinvigorate public awareness and engagement efforts and establish new forums for collaboration. The federal government will work in consultation with a cross-section of Canadian stakeholders to ensure that we collectively enhance cyber security in Canada.

The federal government will lead, in partnership with provinces, territories, and the private sector, the development of a national plan to prevent, mitigate and respond to cyber incidents, one that ensures efficient coordination and effective action.

Technical recommendations

Basic Cybersecurity Measures:

■ Implement strict account and software management - regularly update software, remove unused software and disable unnecessary user accounts.

■ Establish backup procedures to mitigate infrastructure failure from cyberattacks, outages or other unexpected events.

■ Identify and use cybersecurity tools, such as Multi-factor Authentication (MFA), Next-Generation Anti-Virus (NGAV) software, Firewalls, Password Managers, VPNs and Data Loss Prevention (DLP) systems.

■ Protect websites by using a reverse proxy18 or cloud-based security service. These solutions can protect websites against a range of threats including Distributed Denial of Service attacks (DDoS).

DDoS protection services safeguard websites and networks by absorbing or deflecting excessive internet traffic, ensuring that an organisation's online presence remains uninterrupted and secure.

■ Encourage users to check if their private and professional email accounts appear in known data breaches using resources like HaveIBeenPwned.

■ Schedule regular security audits, performed by external third- party experts.

■ Establish Naming Conventions with consistent account naming

Leadership and Collaboration  Strategic Context: Collaborating to Realize the  Benefits of Digital Life   

Advances in technology benefit our communities and our societies. They contribute to our quality of life today, and will be instrumental in meeting the challenges of tomorrow. We all have a responsibility to secure these technologies. Through our National Cyber Security Strategy, the Government of Canada will advance the ways in which we work together to do so.

Raising Baseline Cyber Security in Canada

The vast majority of Canada’s digital systems are owned by individuals and organizations outside of the federal government. From individuals that use few technologies to tech-savvy businesses that are firmly rooted in the online world, many do not realize that they could be the target of cyber threats. As a result, they do not have measures in place to protect

The Government of Canada is taking on a leadership role in cyber security to help organizations and Canadians recognize the value of cyber security and to support efforts to raise the baseline of cyber security in Canada. It will complement these domestic efforts by working with international partners and allies, seeking to reduce the threat to Canada from cybercriminals and also from state actors and their proxies that may seek to harm us.

Moreover, the federal government is aiming for national cyber security excellence. Reaching this target will involve enhancing and growing cyber security capabilities in government and industry. It will entail supporting Canada’s leading edge research and development, as well as the range of organizations and businesses that do not have strong cyber security measures in place. Private sector leaders will have a central role to play, as a collaborative effort is needed to ensure that all Canadians are as equipped

as possible to prevent and respond to cyber threats.

Blockchain technology allows for the creation of online ledgers or records. Often associated with virtual currencies, there are many possible applications of blockchain. It could be used to provide public services like issuing passports, creating records of contracts or legal documents, and processing payments for services rendered.

An Innovative and Adaptive Cyber Ecosystem

By supporting advanced research, fostering digital innovation, and developing cyber skills and knowledge, the federal government will position Canada as a global leader in cyber security.

The Government of Canada will work with partners to drive investment and foster cyber research and development. The Government will focus on emerging areas of Canadian excellence, such as quantum computing and blockchain technologies. The federal government is already making progress in this regard, with Budget 2017 announcing the creation of a Pan- Canadian Artificial Intelligence Strategy for research and talent.

Together, we will explore initiatives to ensure that Canadian companies can bring their products to a global market. The Government will explore initiatives to drive domestic demand for cyber security technologies and services.

The Government of Canada will explore new ideas for making businesses and Canadians of all ages and backgrounds more cyber secure. The federal government has already committed investments to improve digital skills,

such as coding education for kids.

Working together across governments, academia, and the private sector is necessary to address the cyber skills gap. Taking action now will allow us to build the labour force of the future, one that will help to support Canadian cyber security and that will contribute to Canada’s future prosperity.

Executive Summary 

The Importance of Cyber Security

As we embrace digital technologies for their tremendous benefits, we can open ourselves up to threats.

Criminals and other malicious cyber threat actors — many of which operate outside our borders — take advantage of security gaps, low cyber security awareness, and technological developments in an effort to compromise cyber systems. They steal personal and financial information, intellectual property, and trade secrets. They disrupt and sometimes destroy the infrastructure that we rely on for essential services and our way of life.

In 2010, the Government of Canada launched a national effort to defend against these threats with Canada’s first Cyber Security Strategy. The progress made and accomplishments achieved under the 2010 Strategy are the basis for future action.

Our new approach reflects the extent to which digital technologies have become essential to our way of life. With a new Cyber Security Strategy, we can proceed with confidence in our digital age. In this reality, cyber security is the companion to innovation and the protector of prosperity.

The Vision of the National Cyber Security Strategy: Security and prosperity in the digital age

Strong cyber security is an essential element of Canadian innovation and prosperity. Individuals, governments, and businesses all want to have confidence in the cyber systems that underpin their daily lives. The Government of Canada envisions a future in which all Canadians play an active role in shaping and sustaining our nation’s cyber resilience.

Cyber Security Strategy Goals 

Secure and Resilient Canadian Systems

Through collaborative action with partners and enhanced cyber security capabilities, we will better protect Canadians from cybercrime, respond to evolving threats, and defend critical government and private sector systems.

The Government of Canada will maintain and improve cyber security across all federal departments and agencies to protect the privacy of Canadians’ information held by the federal government and the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of critical services for Canadians.

The Government of Canada will enhance law enforcement capacity to respond to cybercrime. It will support coordination across law enforcement agencies and with federal, provincial, territorial, and international partners. The Government will enhance cybercrime investigative capacity and make it easier for Canadians to report cybercrime.

Small and medium organizations often lack the knowledge and resources to implement cyber security regimes, even if doing so would offer a competitive advantage. The Government of Canada will help support these organizations — making cyber security more accessible.

In response to cyber threats of increasing sophistication, the Government of Canada will consider how its advanced cyber capabilities could be applied to defend critical networks in Canada and deter foreign cyber","I. Securing Government systems

The Government of Canada increased its capacity to prevent, detect, respond to, and recover from cyber attacks. The number of data breaches has steadily declined since 2010 — despite an increase in the number and sophistication of state-sponsored and non-state cyber activities against Government networks.

II. Partnering to secure vital cyber systems outside the federal government

Partnerships were forged with owners and operators of Canada’s critical infrastructure, the private sector, and provincial and territorial governments. The Canadian Cyber Incident Response Centre (CCIRC) expanded its operations, with over 1300 organizations receiving regular alerts and communications.

III. Helping Canadians to be secure online

Through the Get Cyber Safe campaign, the Government of Canada supported cyber security awareness with outreach, activities, and development of targeted resources. Efforts made under the 2010 Strategy also improved the capacity of the RCMP and law enforcement agencies to combat cybercrime, including initial investments in cybercrime intelligence, investigations, and training.

Introduction   Building on Canada’s Accomplishments in a  Dynamic Cyber Landscape 

What is Cyber Security?

Cyber security is the protection of digital information and the

infrastructure on which it resides.

Cyber security was once the domain of technical experts, but now, in our

digital world, we all have a role to play in our individual and collective

cyber security.

From the Margins to the Mainstream

The degree to which digital technology is now integrated into our daily lives would have been unimaginable just a few years ago. From social media, smartphone applications, online shopping, networked devices, the cloud, and beyond, we rely on digital technologies for more than personal enjoyment — they are integral to the systems that underpin our economy and our way of life. These interdependent systems include the

communications networks that connect across the country and around the world, energy to heat our homes and power our industry, and air, train, and road travel we use every day.

We tend to take this connectivity for granted, without pausing to reflect on its implications. Cyber security cannot be taken for granted. As the benefits and opportunities of technologies continue to grow, it is increasingly crucial to secure these technologies."

For example, data protection regulations are key considerations for NGOs managing data which must be respected, with reporting obligations in the event of data breaches.

The report purposefully omits detailed information regarding the NGOs that took part in this project. The analysis involved organisations disclosing sensitive information about their vulnerabilities and threat profiles. As such, this precaution is taken to protect the privacy and safety of all the organisations.

This report is not exhaustive and acknowledges that there are other threats, vulnerabilities and actors that come into play from those mentioned herein. There is little available analysis focused on the cyber threat and cybersecurity capacities specific to NGOs. A significant proportion of the analysis currently available is focused on threat actors and their tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) with very limited information on victims, targets and the societal impact of attacks. This report advocates systematic and standardized collection, analysis and sharing of information to provide better responses and facilitate international collaboration.

The CyberPeace Institute welcomes any feedback to develop this knowledge product. Any enquiries regarding the Project or interest in the analysis process are welcome, please visit the Institute’s website to get in contact.

CyberPeace Analytical Report

Why this Analysis? From Data to Action

The aim of this analysis project is to increase understanding of the cyber threat landscape affecting NGOs and aims to provide actionable recommendations.

These recommendations address the following areas:

1. How NGOs can better defend and protect themselves from cyberattacks and their associated impact and harm. A separate technical report is also provided to NGOs with more specificities on technical findings from this project.

2. How donors, policymakers, and companies can contribute to safeguarding NGOs in the face of cyber threats.

Although the focus of the current report is on Geneva-based organizations, this methodology will be replicated in other contexts and serve as a blueprint for future reports on cyber threats against NGOs.

This report is part of the CyberPeace Institute’s broader mission, offering free cybersecurity services to NGOs which includes:

■ Mapping the threat landscape for NGOs.

■ Delivering actionable, free cybersecurity services to NGOs (CyberPeace Builders program1).

■ Producing threat intelligence and automatically alerting NGOs about suspicious cyber activity.

■ Building capacity amongst donors cybersecurity risks of NGOs. to understand the

■ Providing data-driven evidence to regulators.

CyberPeace Analytical Report","Recommendations for the International Geneva

While the key findings shed light on the critical challenges that NGOs in International Geneva face in the realm of cybersecurity, the following recommendations provide a concrete roadmap for action. These recommendations are structured according to a cyber capacity building framework developed by the United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research (UNIDIR)2, covering five key pillars: official documents, processes and structures, partnerships and networks, people and skills, and technology.

Official Documents Related to Cybersecurity Matters:

• NGOs should be recognized as stakeholders with specific needs to which host authorities pay particular attention. Given the role of NGOs, promoting their cybersecurity should be integrated strongly into policies.

• Geneva-based NGOs should develop and implement cybersecurity governance policies and practices, including a cybersecurity policy, an incident response plan, and an asset inventory. The CyberPeace Institute, as a local partner, commits to help them do that.

• The CyberPeace Institute and its academic partners should enhance their efforts to document, track, and analyze cyberattacks against NGOs within the Geneva ecosystem and any subsequent accountability measures taken, including the prosecution of perpetrators.

Processes and Structures:

• Swiss Public authorities should recognize the specific needs of NGOs. In cases involving ransomware, investigations into the financial flow stemming from extortion schemes should be conducted to hinder the activities of threat actors. Public authorities should actively promote the position discouraging the payment of ransom, emphasizing that it directly finances organized crime and encourages further cyberattacks.

• Swiss Public authorities, together with the National Cyber Security Center (NCSC), should actively promote transparent reporting on cyberattacks against NGOs to inform policy-making. Robust

safeguards should be in place to protect the confidentiality and integrity of this information.","Introduction

In the heart of International Geneva, a diverse ecosystem thrives, housing 38 international organizations (IOs), 432 non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and several hundred associations active at an international level, all united by a shared mission: to make the world a place of greater humanity, peace and justice. NGOs are the unsung heroes, responding in armed conflicts, natural disasters, and humanitarian crises, championing human rights, and advancing the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Like many other organizations, NGOs heavily rely on technology, which is critical for projecting their activities globally in real time. Yet, in today’s digital landscape, this reality brings its own set of challenges.

While fighting for the greater good, NGOs must battle against all forms of cyberattacks, ranging from espionage and ransomware to fraud and disinformation. On one side, they are targeted by various threat actors - criminal groups, state actors, terrorist groups or hacktivists - seeking to disrupt their work, compromise data, and tarnish their reputation. On the other, they do not possess the human or financial resources to protect themselves.

In Geneva, the CyberPeace Institute safeguards these heroes. Our cybersecurity services for NGOs include threat landscape mapping, volunteer-led consulting, alert notifications, and providing policy recommendations to donors and public/private decision-makers. All these services are free and tailored to the NGOs’ operational reality.

With the leadership and support of the Republic and Canton of Geneva, this report aims to provide actionable recommendations to build capacities and resilience to mitigate cyber risks. It provides insights on the organizational readiness of NGOs to prevent, respond to and recover from cyberattacks. Using data, including primary data from surveys and interviews, the Report looks at the threats NGOs face, the vulnerabilities they are exposed to, and examines their preparedness to mitigate these challenges. Its ambition is to reinforce NGOs’ resilience in a sustainable manner, and for them to become the primary actors of their cybersecurity.

This report builds on technical analysis conducted by our cyber analysts and a comprehensive survey with 27 Geneva-based NGOs.

6

CyberPeace Institute | 2023

The sample size of 27 NGOs allowed for a detailed examination of each participating NGO, providing an understanding of their unique contexts, challenges, and practices. This depth of analysis can yield nuanced insights that may be obscured in larger samples. These organizations have been selected because they embody the diversity of Geneva NGOs: some conduct their activities in Geneva whilst others operate across the world. Some are small and under-financed, others are well established. They operate in sectors including healthcare, justice, human rights, peace and education and humanitarian relief. Together, these NGOs bring vital aid and services to tens of millions of beneficiaries.

If you are an NGO looking for help with your cybersecurity, we encourage you to reach out to us. We are here to support and protect your vital work in our increasingly digital world.

The CyberPeace Institute is an independent and neutral non- governmental organisation (NGO) that strives to reduce the frequency, impact, and scale of cyberattacks, to hold actors accountable for the harm they cause, and to assist vulnerable communities.

The Institute is based in Geneva, works in close collaboration with relevant partners to reduce the harm from cyberattacks on people’s lives worldwide, and provide assistance. By analysing cyberattacks, it exposes their societal impact, the ways that international laws and norms are being violated, and advances responsible behaviour to enforce cyberpeace.","Project scope and participation of NGOs

In March 2023, a total of 44 Geneva-based NGOs were contacted to participate in the study. Out of the 44 NGOs, 27 agreed to take part in the different stages of the analysis, starting with a survey that was submitted by all participants within the timeframe of 3 to 4 weeks.

The NGOs taking part in this project conduct their activities across a range of sectors, including humanitarian, health, justice, human rights, peace and education. These NGOs bring vital aid and services to tens of millions of beneficiaries across the globe. The NGOs operate internationally across various regions, particularly Europe, Africa, the

52

CyberPeace Institute | 2023

Middle East and Asia. A number of the organizations also operate in North America, Oceana, Latin America and the Caribbean.

Based on OECD classifications21 relating to employee count, 67% of NGOs participating in the project fall into the micro or small-size enterprise brackets, and 33% of NGOs are classified as medium or large-size enterprises:

■ Micro enterprises, defined as those with fewer than 10 employees.

■ Small enterprises, defined as those with 10-49 employees.

■ Medium-sized enterprises, defined as those with 50 to 249 employees ■ Large enterprises, defined as those with over 250 employees.

This report survey to NGOs encompassed multiple-choice and open- ended questions related to organizational size, sector, ability to detect cyber threats, strategies for protection against such threats, and methods for response and recovery following cyberattacks. An internal team of experts, from the CyberPeace Institute, consulted the NIST Cybersecurity Framework to ensure the surveys were designed according to industry standards, whilst being adapted to the operational needs and realities of NGOs. The survey also leveraged the experience of the Institute’s team members who work directly with NGOs through the CyberPeace Builders program. The surveys were conducted in English.

Furthermore, from the 27 NGOs, 6 interviews were conducted with organisations that had direct experience of cyberattacks. These semi- structured interviews gathered qualitative insights with regard to the human-centered understanding of the consequences of cyberattacks. The interviews were conducted in both French and English.

Additionally, 19 of the NGOs participating in the project accepted the analysis team carrying out a technical analysis of their organization’s internet-facing assets to assess if there were identifiable cyber threats and vulnerabilities. The NGOs that participated in this project are being supported by CyberPeace Builders program to have the results of their technical analysis reviewed.

The sample size of 27 NGOs allowed for a detailed examination of each participating NGO, providing an understanding of their unique contexts, challenges, and practices. This depth of analysis can yield nuanced insights that may be obscured in larger samples. However, the sample size, which constitutes approximately 6% of NGOs in Geneva,

Case Study #2: Attack on an NGO website

1. Overview

This case study is about a small NGO based in Geneva whose mission is to provide professional and independent services to assist humanitarian and development organizations in their work. The organization’s website serves as a central platform for communication with partners and clients.

In early 2020, this NGO experienced a cyberattack resulting in the compromise of their website, causing significant disruption to their operations. This case study explores the details of the attack, the organization's response, the impact on their operations, lessons learned, and recommendations.

2. What happened?

In early 2020, the organization fell victim to a website attack. When trying to connect to the website, they discovered that they were automatically redirected to a Chinese language marketplace website. The exact timing of the attack remains uncertain, as it was discovered during a period of reduced monitoring.

Unfortunately, the organization did not have a backup of their website, requiring a full reconstruction of the site which took nine months to complete. While the organization does not believe that they were deliberately targeted by the cyberattack, it appears the attackers were aiming to generate traffic to the marketplace website. The identity of the threat actor remains unknown, and there is no attribution or evidence linking any individual or group to the attack.

What is a website attack?

A website attack refers to a malicious activity or series of actions aimed at compromising the security, functionality, or availability of a website or web application. These attacks target vulnerabilities in websites to gain unauthorized access, steal data, deface web pages, disrupt services, or carry out other malicious activities. Website attacks are typically orchestrated by cybercriminals, hackers, or other threat actors.

39

CyberPeace Analytical Report

There are different types of website attacks. Some of the most common ones include:

■ SQL Injection (SQLi): In an SQL Injection attack, an attacker injects malicious SQL queries into input fields on a website.

■ Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): XSS attacks involve injecting malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users.

■ Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF): In CSRF attacks, attackers trick users into unknowingly executing actions on a website without their consent.

■ Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS): DDoS attacks flood a website's server with a massive volume of traffic, overwhelming its resources and causing it to cease functioning normally or to become unavailable to legitimate users. It is said to be distributed when the source of the attack is composed of a multitude of devices or systems.

■ Website Defacement: The illicit or unauthorized modification of the appearance and content of a target’s website or the act of redirecting traffic to other web pages.",Some key principles from these design guidelines are as follows:,"Actual Incidents

In general, information about actual cyber incidents is rarely made public, thus the report survey asked NGOs if they had been the victim of a cyberattack. The findings in this regard are that:

41%

of NGOs report that they have been the victim of a cyberattack within the past three years.

The most prolific attacks include social engineering (e.g. phishing), ransomware, Denial of Service Attacks (DDoS) and other malware. Other reported attacks included CEO fraud, website impersonation, spyware, Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) and brute-force attacks.

Of those that had experienced cyber incidents, 100% reported that these attacks were not isolated events, with some experiencing cybersecurity incidents daily while others face them on a monthly or annual basis.

The attacks led to a range of adverse impacts on the NGOs, including financial losses, compromised financial data, disruptions to external engagements, disruptions to staff activities and to staff time, and the necessity to revise procedures.

In order to gain a better understanding of the actual impact of cyberattacks, three case studies are presented later in this report. The case studies are based on interviews with three of the surveyed NGOs and look into the specific circumstances of the cyberattacks they experienced. These case studies provide valuable insights into the threat landscape faced by NGOs and the need for effective responses.

CyberPeace Analytical Report

Resilience and Incident Response

Findings show that 70% of NGOs don’t think, or aren’t sure whether, they have an adequate level of resilience to recover from a disruptive cyberattack. When asked about their capacity to monitor cyber risks and respond to incidents:

• 70% of NGOs do not have any incident response, analysis or investigative in-house capabilities in the case of a cyberattack.

• 63% of NGOs do not monitor the clear or dark web for leaked credentials or compromised accounts/infrastructure.

• 37% of NGOs do not believe they have the capability, or are uncertain about their capacity, to detect potential security incidents or suspicious activity.

• 15% of NGOs indicated that they never conduct security assessments or audits of their cybersecurity infrastructure.

• 33% of NGOs indicated that they have acquired, or plan to acquire cyber insurance.",The table below summarises the key use cases identified for the Individuals.,"4. Impact

The ramifications of the cyberattack on the organization were wide-

reaching and profound. Firstly, the attack had a detrimental impact on the organization's image and credibility, as their website remained unavailable for an entire month. During this period, the organization's stakeholders, including partners and clients, were left with a sense of uncertainty, eroding the trust they had previously enjoyed. Internally, the attack led to significant operational disruptions, with communication channels being severely affected, impacting the efficiency and effectiveness of the organization's day-to-day activities. Furthermore, the attack disabled a contact form which hindered interactions with possible collaborators, potentially and temporarily impeding future partnerships with other NGOs. Lastly, the process of reconstructing the website imposed considerable financial costs on the organization, including expenses for web development, hosting, and security measures.

These multifaceted repercussions underscore the critical importance of robust cybersecurity measures and incident preparedness in safeguarding an organization's reputation, operations, and financial stability.

5. Lessons Learned

Some of the key lessons learned by this NGO after this incident include:

i. Maintaining up-to-date backups of their digital assets - a fundamental precautionary measure often overlooked until a crisis unfolds. The experience also underscored the necessity to regularly monitor and implement website updates and patches, reinforcing the imperative of proactive security maintenance.

ii. Ensure robust relationships with service providers, emphasizing the need to consistently verify the adequacy of their security measures.

iii. Enhance staff awareness within the organization regarding the ever present cybersecurity threats and vulnerabilities, reaffirming the importance of continuous education and vigilance safeguarding against potential breaches. in

Case Study #3: A Man-in-the-Middle cyberattack against an NGO

1. Overview

The organization in this case study is a medium-sized non- governmental organization (NGO) based in Geneva. In September 2019, this organization fell victim to a Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) cyberattack. A MitM is a type of cyberattack in which a malicious actor intercepts, with the potential of altering, the communication between two parties without their knowledge or consent. This case study explores the details of the attack, the NGO's response, the impact it had, lessons learned, and recommendations for other NGOs facing similar threats.

2. What happened?

In September 2019, shortly after the summer holidays, the NGO's finance department started following up on pending invoices. They noticed that they had not received payment from an overseas Foundation they worked closely with. The finance team followed up with the Foundation, mentioning that the payment had not been made. The Foundation responded to the NGO confirming that they had paid, with proof of payment. The NGO noticed that on these emails, the domain of the emails contained the characters “nn” in the place of “m” and that a spoof domain was being used. This is when the NGO realized that they were the victims of a MitM cyberattack.

Upon further investigation, the NGO realized that the Foundation had received a second email with the same invoice but with different banking details on the invoice. The attackers skillfully edited a PDF invoice and set up a spoof domain with an optically close name resembling the NGO’s real domain. This false domain was used to send a second email with the same email addresses in “to” and “cc” as the original email but all on the spoof domain."
